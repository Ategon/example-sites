Restaurant Editing & Express

To run the server:
- navigate to the folder in a terminal
- type npm install to install dependencies
- type "node server.js" to start the server

Then you can go to localhost:3000 to get the home page for the website
The header in the top right lets you move between the home page, restaurants page and addrestaurant page

**Restaurants
clicking the name of one of the restaurants brings you to that restaurant page
Restaurants that have most recently been edited to go the bottom of the restaurants list

**Addrestaurant
Typing in data and then hitting the add button adds the restaurant to the server
Only positive numbers are accepted for things involving prices and all fields must have data to be able to submit

**Restaurant
The table of contents on the left allows you to quickly travel to different sections of the menu by clicking on the menu categories
The menu in the center lists the local copy of the restaurant even if it hasnt been saved to the server yet
The right side has two forms, one to add a category and one to add an item
Hitting the save button saves all changes to the server
When the screen shrinks to a width below 800px the columns merge into one to allow the information to be easily seen on mobile
